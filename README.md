# Coding Challenge 9

Through this project, we learn about `D3.js` library and how to include it in an HTML file. We also learn how to create `div` elements using **JavaScript** and design the CSS using `style` tag in the HTML file. Moreover, we develop skills to add interactive to web elements using `D3.js` library, such as changing their appearance on user actions like `mouseover` and `mouseout`.
